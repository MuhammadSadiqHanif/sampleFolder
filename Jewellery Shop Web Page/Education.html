                <dd>What completely ruins your imitation jewelry is a hot and humid environment. You need making sure that you store it in a dry and cool place to make sure that it doesn't catch rust.
                </dd>

                <dd>Perfume is one of the biggest spoilers of artificial Pakistani jewelry so you need to keep it at an arm's length. In case you need wearing perfume or deodorant, spray it on your clothes before you wear the jewelry.
                </dd> 
            <dt>Store it in a Plastic Bag</dt>
